# My Therapy

My Therapy is a therapy notebook for the patient to write about his or her thoughts on a daily basis. This digital space is shared with his or her therapist who can read their written documents before or during the session.

The goal ? Keep a written records of triggers, thoughts and behaviors and provide a basis for the next therapy session.

For this project, we included the following features : 
- a plateform with two paths, one for the patient and one for the doctor. They are connected through collection relationships.
- Sign up, sign in, sign out and protected routes through middlewares for both paths with a flash messages dynamic.
- The ability to edit or delete their profiles for both patient and doctor.
- a CRUD on patient side for their documents
- ajax on doctor side when displaying his or her patient infos
